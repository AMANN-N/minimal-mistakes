## Experience

**ML Engineer**  
*OfBusiness (OFB Tech Pvt Ltd) | Gurugram, India | Jan 2024 - Present*
*   Built NLP models, sector classification systems, and predictive analytics pipelines at OFB-Nexizo, improving business insight accuracy, accelerating automated content creation through image generation and cutting manual effort by 40%.
*   Created an AutoModel pipeline which increased system efficiency by reducing multiple model training and review steps to one.
*   Worked on automatic Code debugging service which could identify bugs from system logs and create a PR with a fix with 0 human input.

**Software Engineer / SDE Intern**  
*OfBusiness (OFB Tech Pvt Ltd) | Gurugram, India*
*   Implemented and scaled features for OASys, an order management system at OfBusiness. Improved performance and database queries reducing latency by more than 50 percent for more than 500k users.
*   Upgraded a 1.2 Million line codebase to Spring Boot 3.3, Hibernate 6.5, and Java 21, modernising the tech stack from legacy versions.
*   Upgraded legacy databases to latest versions (MongoDB 8, Redis 8, MySQL 8), enhancing system stability, performance, and long-term scalability.

**Intern**  
*The Brain and Cognition Research Center (CerCo) | Toulouse, France | July 2023 - Dec 2023*
*   Built advanced speech recognition models in PyTorch, applying sub-sampling and dilated convolutions to boost accuracy, achieving a 5% increase in accuracy compared to the baseline model.
*   Worked on integrating that model into a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) to assist patients with speech difficulties in recognition, production and leveraging brain signals for real-time communication.

**Intern**  
*Kreiman Lab @ Harvard Medical School | Boston, MA (Remote) | Nov 2022 - June 2023*
*   Engaged in diverse AI projects centred on **language and vision** tasks, leveraging advanced Machine and Deep Learning algorithms, including GPT, to investigate the **Turing Test**.
*   Developed a user-friendly web application using **JsPsych** to facilitate experiments and gather data for refining the assessment of human and machine imitation capabilities.
*   Conducted a comparative study of multiple **LLMs**, analyzing their performance on **Turing Test–style evaluations** to assess human-like language capabilities.
