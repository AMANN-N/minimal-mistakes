- GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)
- Backpropagation through time (BPTT)
- Sequence-to-sequence architecture

## Technologies Used
- **Framework:** PyTorch, NumPy
- **Concepts:** Sequential modeling, Hidden states, Gradient flow
- **Applications:** Language modeling, Time-series prediction, Sequence generation
