**Type:** Machine Learning Algorithm  
**Framework:** NumPy  

## Overview
Implementation of K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm from scratch, a simple yet powerful non-parametric method for classification and regression.

## Key Components
- Distance metrics (Euclidean, Manhattan)
- K-nearest neighbor search
- Majority voting for classification
- Weighted averaging for regression
- Cross-validation

## Technologies Used
- **Framework:** NumPy, Scikit-learn (for comparison)
- **Concepts:** Instance-based learning, Distance metrics, Lazy learning
- **Applications:** Pattern recognition, Recommendation systems
