## Research Goal

Speech recognition in clinical contexts presents challenges beyond standard benchmarks, including noisy signals, limited data, and strict latency requirements.  
The goal of this work was to improve model robustness while keeping architectures suitable for downstream integration with BCI systems.

---

## Key Contributions

- Developed **speech recognition models in PyTorch**, experimenting with architectural changes such as:
Temporal sub-sampling
Dilated convolutions for improved receptive fields
- Achieved a **~5% accuracy improvement** over baseline models through architectural and training refinements.
- Analyzed model behavior to balance accuracy gains against computational and latency constraints.
- Worked on integrating the speech recognition model into a **brain–computer interface pipeline**.
- Explored how decoded speech outputs could support patients with speech production and recognition difficulties.

## Outcomes & Learnings

- Improved understanding of **speech modeling under constrained and noisy conditions**.
- Gained hands-on experience with **applied deep learning in neuroscience and healthcare contexts**.
- Worked closely with researchers across neuroscience and machine learning, bridging experimental goals with implementable systems.
