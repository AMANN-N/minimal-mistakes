> 🧠 **Objective:** Advance cognitive-AI research by studying how closely Large Language Models can approximate human communication and reasoning, using structured Turing Test–style experiments.

## Overview
During my research internship at **Kreiman Lab — Harvard Medical School (Boston, MA | Remote)**, I led development and evaluation efforts for experimental AI systems designed to compare **human responses vs GPT-based LLMs** in linguistic reasoning tasks.  
I built a controlled **human experiment platform using JsPsych**, collected behavioral data, and analyzed LLM performance to support an academic publication.

## 🔍 Research Problem
Evaluating “human-like intelligence” in AI requires more than benchmark scores—**we need experiments where humans interact and are compared directly against AI responses**, similar to the Turing Test, but measurable and repeatable.

---

## 🛠 Approach & Solution
- Built a **JsPsych-based experimental web platform** enabling structured interactions between participants and LLMs.
- Collected response samples from both humans and models to measure linguistic similarity, reasoning depth, and deception capability.
- Conducted **comparative benchmarking across multiple GPT-based models** using controlled Turing-Test-style evaluation.
- Automated experiment management and dataset processing to generate reproducible analysis reports.
