## Research Goal

Standard NLP benchmarks capture task performance, but they often fail to measure **human-likeness** in reasoning, response style, and deception.
The goal of this work was to explore whether LLMs could be **indistinguishable from humans in controlled interaction settings**, and to design experiments where this comparison could be measured quantitatively.

---

## Key Contributions

- Built a **browser-based experimental platform** using JsPsych to run controlled human studies.
- Designed interaction protocols where participants responded to prompts identical to those given to language models.
- Collected and organized paired datasets of **human and model-generated responses**.
- Performed comparative analysis across multiple language models under Turing-style conditions.
- Automated experiment execution and data aggregation to ensure repeatability and statistical rigor.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**, PyTorch, HuggingFace Transformers
- **JsPsych**, JavaScript, HTML/CSS
- Pandas, NumPy
- Statistical analysis and visualization tooling
