## Key Contributions

* Built and maintained relevance and classification pipelines used to match large volumes of documents and entities with high precision.
* Designed automated model pipelines to reduce manual retraining, evaluation, and review overhead.
* Implemented retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for structured and unstructured enterprise data.
* Introduced embedding reuse and caching strategies to reduce inference cost and latency in high-traffic systems.
* Integrated LLM-based OCR and enrichment workflows to extract usable signals from noisy, real-world documents.
* Worked on LLM-driven automation tools, including systems that reason over logs and system outputs to assist with debugging and remediation.
* Iterated on prompt design and evaluation to improve output reliability and reduce downstream errors
