## Overview
Implementing CUDA kernels and optimizations from *Programming Massively Parallel Processors* to gain practical expertise in GPU architecture and kernel tuning.

## Key Achievements
*   Worked on profiling and refining kernels for higher throughput/occupancy, applying memory coalescing and shared-memory strategies to improve performance by up to 30%.
