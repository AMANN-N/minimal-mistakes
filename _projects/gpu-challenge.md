## Overview
Implementing CUDA kernels and optimizations from *Programming Massively Parallel Processors* to gain practical expertise in GPU architecture and kernel tuning.

## Key Achievements
*   Worked on profiling and refining kernels for higher throughput/occupancy, applying memory coalescing and shared-memory strategies to improve performance by up to 30%.

## Technical Details
This project involved deep diving into:
1.  **Memory Coalescing**: Ensuring global memory accesses are aligned.
2.  **Shared Memory Tiling**: Reducing global memory bandwidth pressure.
3.  **Warp Divergence**: Minimizing control flow divergence within warps.
