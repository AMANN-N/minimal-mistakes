Built a complete machine learning pipeline that handles data ingestion, model training, deployment, and monitoring in production.

## Key Features
*   Real-time prediction API with sub-100ms latency
*   Automated retraining pipeline with drift detection
*   A/B testing framework for model comparison

## Technologies Used
*   Python, FastAPI, Docker
*   MLflow, Prometheus, Grafana
*   AWS (S3, EC2, Lambda)
