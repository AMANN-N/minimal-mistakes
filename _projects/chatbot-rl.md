## Overview

This project explores how **reinforcement learning can be combined with sequence-to-sequence models** to improve conversational quality in simulated dialogue settings.

Instead of relying purely on supervised learning, the chatbot is trained to optimize conversation-level objectives, encouraging more coherent and context-aware responses over time.

---

## Key Details

- Built a **Seq2Seq conversational model** with a bi-directional RNN encoder and global attention.
- Designed a **reinforcement learning loop** on top of supervised training to optimize dialogue behavior.
- Implemented training and evaluation pipelines to iteratively improve response quality.
- Focused on understanding how reward signals influence long-term conversational coherence.

## Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python  
- **Frameworks:** PyTorch  
- **Concepts:** Seq2Seq models, Attention mechanisms, Reinforcement Learning, NLP
